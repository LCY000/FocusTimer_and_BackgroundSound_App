# FocusTimer & BackgroundSound App
This is a computer program that helps us use the Pomodoro timer on the computer.  
It also has a background music function.  
It can achieve the same effect as using the background sound function on iOS on the computer.

Notice:  Because Github cannot upload files exceeding 100MB, some audio files (background sounds) do not have files in Github.  

## How to use
After downloading the project to your computer, execute the following command on the project.

```bash
gradle run
```
